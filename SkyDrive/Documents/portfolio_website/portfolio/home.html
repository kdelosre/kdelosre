			<p>Hey there! Welcome to my site!</p>

			<h3>What can you see from me?</h3>

			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<article>Welcome and thank you for visiting the portfolio website of Kirstie Delos Reyes! I am currently attending the University of California, Irvine working 
			on a BS in Informatics with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction. I will graduate at the end of the Winter
			2017 quarter. I aspire to create or build software or something neat with a bunch of people! I'm a person who also loves fun and being engaged to do and organize activities with others. Bring it on to let me make something cool! 

			<p>My hobbies include drawing, lion dancing, hanging out with friends, and playing video games. On the side of what I mainly do from the tech industry is artwork. I am also a self-taught artist and love to come up with character and concept designs and illustrations. If you are interested in checking out the artwork I create feel free to check them out on the Projects page. If you are interested in a commission from me please check out the Commissions page for more information.</p></article>
